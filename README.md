WordSnipe is a 2D typing and score attack game, built with the [Godot engine](https://godotengine.org/).

Players are faced with waves of random letters, and need to type out words using them in order to shoot the letters down and avoid taking damage.

Letter spawning is weighted according to [Scrabble letter distributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrabble_letter_distributions)

Words are validated against [this list](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words) of English words, as well as needing to be more than 2 letters long.

The difficulty of the game increases over time, increasing the speed of approaching letters and lowering the time between letters spawning to compensate.

Each letter that hits the player deals damage. Once the player takes 10 damage, the game is over.
